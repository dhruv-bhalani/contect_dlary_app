# Platform Converter App

Platform Converter is a Flutter application that allows users to manage their contacts and customize their app's theme based on platform preferences. Users can add, edit, and delete contacts, make calls, and switch between iOS and Android-themed views. The app retains theme preferences using local storage, creating a consistent experience on every launch.
